Part 1
- This program (validParentheses.java) implements a solution to determine if a given string of parentheses s is valid. A valid string satisfies these conditions:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Part 2
- This program (validParenthesesTest.java) verifies the correctness of three methods (testIsValid, testIsInvalid, testEdges) using unit testing. It tests the validParenthesis.java program with different test cases.

Part 3
- This program (pyramidRubiksCube.java) designs a data structure to represent a Pyramid Rubik's Cube, including the state, edges, and faces requires for solving it.
